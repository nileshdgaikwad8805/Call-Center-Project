# Call Center Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive call center dashboard, leveraging key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor and analyze the efficiency and performance of the call center. The dashboard provides insights into overall customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, average speed of answer, and agent performance based on average handle time vs. calls answered.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Overall Customer Satisfaction

- Monitoring and analyzing customer satisfaction to ensure a positive customer experience.

### 2. Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned

- Tracking the overall volume of calls handled and identifying trends in call abandonment rates.

### 3. Calls by Time

- Analyzing call distribution over specific time intervals to identify peak call times and optimize staffing.

### 4. Average Speed of Answer

- Measuring the average time it takes for calls to be answered, ensuring efficient call handling.

### 5. Agentâ€™s Performance Quadrant

- Evaluating agent performance based on the quadrant of average handle time (talk duration) vs. calls answered.

## Dashboard Components

The call center dashboard comprises interactive visualizations and metrics to provide a real-time snapshot of call center performance. The dashboard includes:

- Customer satisfaction trends
- Call volume and abandonment rates
- Time-based call distribution charts
- Average speed of answer metrics
- Agent performance quadrant analysis

## Technologies Used

The dashboard is implemented using PowerBi, to create an interactive and user-friendly interface.
